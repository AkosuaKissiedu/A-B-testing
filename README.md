A/B Testing Analysis
This project performs an A/B test analysis to evaluate whether a new webpage improves user conversions compared to the existing one. It includes:

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Understanding the dataset and checking for inconsistencies.

Conversion Rate Calculation: Computing conversion rates for control (old page) and treatment (new page) groups.

Statistical Testing:
Z-Test: To determine if the difference in conversion rates is statistically significant.
Chi-Square Test: To assess if observed conversions differ significantly from expected values.

Hypothesis Testing:
Null Hypothesis (𝐻0): The new webpage has no effect on conversion rates.
Alternative Hypothesis (𝐻𝐴): The new webpage affects conversion rates.

The results help determine whether to adopt the new webpage based on statistical evidence.
